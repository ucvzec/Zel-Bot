Message [10/23/2018 22:01:10]: one: a measure of the quality of the future spouse you were referring to
Message [10/23/2018 22:01:10]: one: uh
Message [10/23/2018 22:01:18]: one: ambient dimension?
Message [10/23/2018 22:01:49]: Frisco: Dimension of the space you are operating in
Message [10/23/2018 22:02:26]: Frisco: A circle is a one dimensional object in the second ambient dimension
Message [10/23/2018 22:02:57]: Frisco: ^a space of the second ambient direction
Message [10/23/2018 22:03:58]: Frisco: Iâ€™m thinking no
Message [10/23/2018 22:04:36]: one: wouldn't surfaces simply be areas in the second ambient dimension?
Message [10/23/2018 22:05:02]: one: or maybe paths?
Message [10/23/2018 22:05:15]: Frisco: Surface area of a 3D object
Message [10/23/2018 22:05:29]: Frisco: Is the surface integral
Message [10/23/2018 22:06:11]: Frisco: But a 2d object is, like you said, just plain old area
Message [10/23/2018 22:06:35]: Frisco: Meaning just a regular double integral is needed
Message [10/23/2018 22:06:43]: one: but if the space is 2D then only a slice of the 3D object can exist
the surface would correspond to the arc lenght
right?
Message [10/23/2018 22:07:19]: Frisco: Think of the surface area of the top of a cylinder
Message [10/23/2018 22:07:45]: Frisco: Itâ€™s part of a 3D object but still has area in 2d
Message [10/23/2018 22:07:53]: Frisco: I think I understand now
Message [10/23/2018 22:08:34]: one: what does 'exist' here even mean?
Message [10/23/2018 22:09:18]: one: because no property of a slice of a 3D object to can correspond fully to the surface area of the 3D object
Message [10/23/2018 22:09:32]: Frisco: 
Message [10/23/2018 22:09:42]: Frisco: Last column
